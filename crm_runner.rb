Implement the Database Class
1. As a developer, I should implement the database class as an array that accepts new
contacts.
2. As a developer, the database class should have the following methods: "add",
"modify_contact", "display_all_contacts", "display_particular_contact",
"display_info_by_attribute" and "delete_contact".
