Implement the Contact Class
1. As a developer, the contact class should have five attributes: "id", "firstname",
"lastname", "email" and "notes".
2. As a developer, when a user creates a contact, all five attributes are mandatory.
3. As a developer, I am able to modify those attributes at any point in the program at a later
time.
4. The Contact class should also have a method that displays all of its values
