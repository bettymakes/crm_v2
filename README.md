Assignment #04: Customer Relationship Management Tool (CRM)

Implement the Contact Class
1. As a developer, the contact class should have five attributes: "id", "firstname",
"lastname", "email" and "notes".
2. As a developer, when a user creates a contact, all five attributes are mandatory.
3. As a developer, I am able to modify those attributes at any point in the program at a later
time.
4. The Contact class should also have a method that displays all of its values.


Implement the Database Class
1. As a developer, I should implement the database class as an array that accepts new
contacts.
2. As a developer, the database class should have the following methods: "add",
"modify_contact", "display_all_contacts", "display_particular_contact",
"display_info_by_attribute" and "delete_contact".


Implement the Runner
1. As a user, I am presented with a prompt to 'add', 'modify', 'display all', 'display contact',
display attribute', 'delete' and 'exit'.
2. As a user, if 'add' is typed, I am prompted to give my 'first name', 'last name', 'email' and
'notes'.
3. As a user, if 'modify' is typed, I am prompted to enter a contact attribute to be modified.
a. As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to type 'yes' or 'no' to
confirm my selection.
b. As a user, if 'yes' is typed, I am prompted to change 'id', 'firstname', 'lastname'
and 'email'.
c. As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to enter a new value for
the attribute.
d. As a user, if 'no' is typed, I am returned back to the main menu.
4. As a user, if 'display all' is typed, I am shown all of the contacts that exist.
5. As a user, if 'display contact' is typed, I am shown a particular contact.
6. As a user, if 'display attribute' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute so that I can
see all of the contacts according to that attribute.
7. As a user, if 'delete' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute value of the contact to
be deleted.
8. As a user, if 'exit' is typed, I am exited out of the program and returned to the command
line.
